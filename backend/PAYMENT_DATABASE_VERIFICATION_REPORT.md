- `fee_structures_year_branch_status`: (academic_year, branch_id, status)
- `fee_structures_due_status`: (due_date, status)

**Payment Transactions:**
- `payment_transactions_student_branch_date`: (student_id, branch_id, payment_date)
- `payment_transactions_unique_id`: (transaction_id) - UNIQUE
- `payment_transactions_branch_status_date`: (branch_id, status, payment_date)
- `payment_transactions_method_branch`: (payment_method, branch_id)

**Payment Methods:**
- `payment_methods_student_branch_active`: (student_id, branch_id, is_active)

### âœ… Data Integrity Verification

- **âœ… No orphaned fee structures:** All fee structures reference valid templates
- **âœ… Valid student references:** All student_id references exist in students collection
- **âœ… Correct balance calculations:** All balance fields match (total_amount - paid_amount)
- **âœ… Proper branch filtering:** All operations respect branch_id boundaries

### âœ… Sample Data Created

**Fee Templates:**
- Tuition Fee - Grade 5: $3,000.00 (annual, installments allowed)
- Registration Fee: $150.00 (one-time)
- Activity Fee: $250.00 (semester)

**Fee Structures:** 30 structures created for test students
**Payment Transactions:** Successfully processed test payments
**Invoices:** Sample invoice generation working

### âœ… Query Performance Tests
